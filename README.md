# PURPOSE
The most common gene cluster detection algorithms focus on canonical “core”
biosynthetic functions many gene clusters encode, while overlooking uncommon or
unknown cluster classes. These overlooked clusters are a potential source of
novel natural products and comprise an untold portion of overall gene cluster
repertoires. Unbiased, function-agnostic detection algorithms therefore provide
an opportunity to reveal novel classes of gene clusters and more broadly define
genome organization. *CLOCI* (Co-occurrence Locus and Orthologous Cluster
Identifier) is an algorithm that identifies gene clusters using multiple
proxies of selection for coordinated gene evolution. In the process, *CLOCI*
circumscribes loci into homologous locus groups, which is an extension of
orthogroups to the locus-level. Our approach generalizes gene cluster detection and gene cluster family circumscription, improves detection of multiple known functional classes, and unveils noncanonical gene clusters. *CLOCI* is suitable for genome-enabled specialized metabolite mining, and presents an easily tunable approach for delineating gene cluster families and homologous loci.
